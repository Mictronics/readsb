dump1090-mutability (1.10.3010.14mu-11) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Fix UTC clock display in non-UTC timezones.
  * Layout tweaks in the info panel.
  * Change plane color if we have not seen a recent position update
    (previously, any type of message was enough).
  * Fix thinko in skipping over decoded message samples in the 2.4MHz demodulator.
  * Fix a couple of problems found by valgrind.
  * Fix several problems with surface position decoding and relative
    position decoding.
  * Fix hang on exit after SIGINT.

dump1090-mutability (1.10.3010.14mu-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Many changes to aircraft.json and the webserver code:

  * Restructure to include the current timestamp, and move
    aircraft data down a level. If you're processing the JSON yourself,
    you will need to adjust your code to handle this.
  * Only include aircraft data when we are sure it's valid.
  * Include the time of the last position report in.
  * If the aircraft is on the ground, report altitude as "ground".
  * Strip trailing query strings from URLs before matching, to allow AJAX
    cache-busting query strings to work.
  * Disable the lighttpd stat cache in the provided config fragment, to
    avoid problems with partial content being served if lighttpd caches an
    old size for the JSON data. This would manifest as "bad content length"
    or JSON parse errors in the webmap.

  * Many changes to the webmap javascript:

  * Internal restructuring of how the plane table and map markers are
    maintained. Should be faster and less memory-hungry.
  * Sorting the plane table now sorts missing data high (end of the table for an
    ascending sort).
  * On-the-ground aircraft display an altitude of "ground".
  * Dashed tracks are used when there are lots of missing position reports (more
    than 5 seconds between positions).
  * Green tracks are used for on-the-ground aircraft.
  * Limit history storage requirements by only retaining at most one position
    per 5 seconds.
  * Removal of old aircraft should be much more reliable now, even across
    long pauses (e.g. browser hibernation).
  * Change the clocks to be two UTC clocks: one from local browser time,
    one reflecting the receiver timestamp in the last update.
  * Add "total aircraft" and "total aircraft with positions" counters to the
    infobox when no aircraft is selected.
  * Add a "history positions" counter to the infobox when no aircraft is
    selected; this shows the number of points making up the historical track
    lines.
  * When an aircraft is selected, show both metric and imperial units in the
    infobox (metric setting controls which is shown first).
  * When an aircraft is selected, show the time since last message and time
    since last position message in the infobox.
  * If aircraft.json can't be retrieved, display a warning.
  * If aircraft.json can be retrieved but doesn't appear to be being updated
    (e.g. external webserver, and dump1090 has stopped), display a warning.
  * config.js: Change the default map zoom setting to be more zoomed in.
  * config.js: Add some comments.
  * config.js: Add an option to hide the clocks.
  * Remove extension.js and options.js, as they aren't really maintained.
  * Enable strict mode for script.js / planeObject.js.

  * Fix initial map centering to correctly use the receiver location.

dump1090-mutability (1.10.3010.14mu-9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix warnings. Add -Werror so they break the build in future.
  * Remove dead tracking code related to the removed PlanePlotter feed.

dump1090-mutability (1.10.3010.14mu-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Version-only rebuild to reflect the upstream dump1090 version we
    have merged from. Retaining the trailing build number to avoid
    confusion (as far as that's possible given this versioning system!)

dump1090-mutability (1.08.2302.14+1mu-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Notice if we lose the RTLSDR device, and try to reconnect when that happens.
    This lets you unplug/replug the RTLSDR without dump1090 exiting, and also
    lets dump1090 tolerate occasional USB glitches that make the dongle reset
    itself.
  * Fix some of the more glaring pthread bugs.
  * Center the webmap on the receiver location.
  * Mark config.js as a conffile, so user changes won't get overwritten.

dump1090-mutability (1.08.2302.14+1mu-6) unstable; urgency=medium

dump1090-mutability (1.08.2302.14+1mu-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove half-implemented --no-decode option.
  * Remove Windows support files that aren't needed for the Debian package.
  * Remove some legacy support scripts not needed by the Debian package.
  * Add support for controlling the accuracy of the receiver location
    written in the JSON metadata used by the webmap.
  * Oversampling is now less scary!
  * Warn if --modeac is used together with --oversample.
  * Link to github from the webmap.

dump1090-mutability (1.08.2302.14+1mu-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ask about json interval before json dir and skip the dir question if
    the interval is disabled, it makes more sense that way.
  * Be much more cautious about missing config settings so we don't explode
    so badly if something is omitted.
  * Use the package version as the version number compiled into the binary.
  * Add data/receiver.json (generated once) and support for it in script.js.
  * Internal webserver rearrangement to support multiple json files.
  * Dongle "device index" actually accepts serial numbers too, document that.
  * Add input validation to most of the config questions.

  * Add direct support for FATSV-format output, adapted from the FlightAware
    fork.
  * Big rearrangement of configuration to add debconf support.
  * Update Build-Depends based on glitches found building under pbuilder.
